      <h2>History</h2>
      <p>Founded in 2022, Rapids Explorer emerged as a vision born from a passion for adventure and a love for the untamed beauty of rivers. Established just two short years ago, our journey has been one of growth, excitement, and a commitment to delivering unparalleled rafting experiences.
        In 2020, a group of avid river enthusiasts came together with a shared dream: to create a rafting company that not only challenged the status quo but also celebrated the raw power and magnificence of nature. Thus, Rapids Explorer was born, with a mission to provide thrill-seekers and nature lovers alike with the ultimate white-water rafting adventures.</p>
